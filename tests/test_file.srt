1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000


2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000


3
00:00:21,958 --> 00:00:24,875
[Elodie]
There are many stories of chivalry

4
00:00:24,958 --> 00:00:28,291
where the heroic knight saves the damsel in distress.

5
00:00:29,958 --> 00:00:32,958
This is not one of them.

6
00:00:34,791 --> 00:00:36,416
[horses chuffing]

7
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:38,333
[tense music playing]

8
00:00:49,875 --> 00:00:52,458
[wings flapping]

9
00:01:05,666 --> 00:01:07,041
[King] There it is.

10
00:01:07,833 --> 00:01:09,291
Form up!

11
00:01:11,625 --> 00:01:13,375
Let's kill the beast.

12
00:01:13,458 --> 00:01:15,875
For glory! Hyah!

13
00:01:30,458 --> 00:01:31,333
Be on guard.

14
00:01:52,416 --> 00:01:55,916
[soft cracking]

15
00:02:00,083 --> 00:02:01,958
[dragon snarls]

16
00:02:02,041 --> 00:02:04,041
[swords clanging]

17
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:08,375
[dragon roaring]

18
00:02:12,333 --> 00:02:13,250
Form the line!

19
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:23,541
[soldiers breathing shakily]

20
00:02:25,083 --> 00:02:28,500
[dragon snarls, shrieks]

21
00:02:29,833 --> 00:02:31,583
[soldiers screaming]

22
00:02:44,958 --> 00:02:45,791
Hold!

23
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:52,333
[wings flapping]

24
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:57,291
[soldiers screaming]

25
00:03:07,041 --> 00:03:08,916
[dragon snarls]

26
00:03:25,166 --> 00:03:26,500
[panting]

27
00:03:32,541 --> 00:03:33,791
[grunts]

28
00:03:45,375 --> 00:03:46,750
[Floria] The last I could find.

29
00:03:47,333 --> 00:03:49,916
[Elodie] Did you take the tapestries into town like Father asked?

30
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,333
[Floria] This morning.

31
00:03:51,416 --> 00:03:54,541
We should take the furs too, and the drapes.

32
00:03:54,625 --> 00:03:55,541
Not the drapes!

33
00:03:55,625 --> 00:03:57,916
You hate that pattern in your room anyway.

34
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,625
They serve a purpose.

35
00:03:59,708 --> 00:04:02,541
Floria, our people are freezing.

36
00:04:02,625 --> 00:04:03,541
And starving.

37
00:04:05,291 --> 00:04:07,291
[carriage driver shouting indistinctly]

38
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:11,791
Who'd come this far north?

39
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,125
[Floria] Elodie, why are they leaving?

40
00:04:22,208 --> 00:04:24,333
[Elodie] There's nothing left for them here, Floria.

41
00:04:28,791 --> 00:04:30,875
[man 1] I don't have enough. Please, I'm hungry.

42
00:04:30,958 --> 00:04:32,416
[woman 1] For food, join the line!

43
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,541
-[man 2] Keep to one side.
-[man 3] I'm starving.

44
00:04:35,083 --> 00:04:36,000
All right then.

45
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:38,708
[man 4] Get off! It's mine!

46
00:04:38,791 --> 00:04:41,833
-Hey! Give me back my food.
-Get off of me, old man!

47
00:04:41,916 --> 00:04:43,000
You've had enough!

48
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:45,291
[woman 2] Share this with your sister. Go on.

49
00:04:45,375 --> 00:04:47,750
-Could you see who it was?
-[guard] A stranger, my lady.

50
00:04:47,833 --> 00:04:50,083
They may take whatever wood they can carry.

51
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:51,625
-I'll see to it.
-Come on, Flor.

52
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:53,125
-[woman 2] Move on.
-[woman 3] Yes.

53
00:04:53,208 --> 00:04:54,666
-[man 5] Get in line.
-Give it to me.

54
00:04:55,333 --> 00:04:57,666
-[woman] I want to meet her first.
-Father?

55
00:05:01,875 --> 00:05:03,250
You must be Elodie.

56
00:05:03,833 --> 00:05:04,833
I am.

57
00:05:18,875 --> 00:05:19,833
She will do.

58
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:22,291
[Lord Bayford sighs softly]

59
00:05:26,208 --> 00:05:29,541
-[Red Priestess] We await your decision.
-Thank you, Your Holiness.

60
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:32,333
Please, this way.

61
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,250
Father, what's happening?

62
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:39,291
Who is that?

63
00:05:40,666 --> 00:05:42,083
[reading indistinctly]

64
00:05:42,166 --> 00:05:43,000
Stepmother?

65
00:05:45,708 --> 00:05:46,750
Well, what is it?

66
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,291
[Lord Bayford] From the Queen of Aurea.

67
00:05:49,833 --> 00:05:51,166
[chuckles softly]

68
00:05:53,125 --> 00:05:54,125
A proposal.

69
00:05:54,208 --> 00:05:56,250
-Oh, my goodness.
-[Lord Bayford] Huh…

70
00:05:57,333 --> 00:05:59,500
-I have made a match.
-May I?

71
00:05:59,583 --> 00:06:00,791
[Lord Bayford] Uh-huh.

72
00:06:01,958 --> 00:06:03,041
He is a prince.

73
00:06:03,875 --> 00:06:04,791
A prince?

74
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,875
I know you've always wished to travel, as did your mother.

75
00:06:09,666 --> 00:06:12,125
Go. See the world.

76
00:06:12,208 --> 00:06:16,291
This man, he has a fleet of ships, carriages full of gold.

77
00:06:16,875 --> 00:06:18,666
That's no reason to marry.

78
00:06:19,833 --> 00:06:21,041
We need this.

79
00:06:22,083 --> 00:06:23,916
Our stores are empty.

80
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,041
We will not make it to the thaw.

81
00:06:28,208 --> 00:06:29,583
Your people need you.

82
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:32,208
Hey.

83
00:06:34,916 --> 00:06:36,208
This is who we are.

84
00:06:48,625 --> 00:06:50,000
[sailor 1] Get to the port side.

85
00:06:50,625 --> 00:06:51,791
[sailor 2] Port side.

86
00:06:54,916 --> 00:06:57,083
[indistinct chatter]

87
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:59,625
Elodie, what's the matter?

88
00:07:00,541 --> 00:07:01,541
Nothing.

89
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:06,416
Father says it's natural to be nervous

90
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,666
about meeting your new husband and his family.

91
00:07:09,583 --> 00:07:10,791
They're strangers.

92
00:07:11,375 --> 00:07:15,000
I've never heard of the Kingdom of Aurea until Father sprang this on me.

93
00:07:15,083 --> 00:07:16,250
[sailor 1] Mind the lines.

94
00:07:16,791 --> 00:07:17,666
Oh!

95
00:07:18,875 --> 00:07:22,333
Are you crazy?
What are you two doing up there?

96
00:07:22,916 --> 00:07:24,041
Come down here.

97
00:07:25,041 --> 00:07:26,166
Come on.

98
00:07:30,291 --> 00:07:32,833
This is how you want your prince to meet you?

99
00:07:32,916 --> 00:07:34,958
Scared, cold as a corpse.

100
00:07:35,041 --> 00:07:37,208
Nose all drippy and wet.

101
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:40,666
What have I been telling you this entire trip?

102
00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:43,583
-[both] First impressions are everything.
-Hmm.

103
00:07:43,666 --> 00:07:45,000
[sailor 2] Come on, lift up.

104
00:07:45,083 --> 00:07:47,541
-[exhales sharply]
-[sailor blowing horn]

105
00:07:52,916 --> 00:07:54,125
[sailor 3] Look at that.

106
00:08:06,666 --> 00:08:08,750
I have good news, girls.

107
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:12,083
The captain informs me we approach Aurea's coastline.

108
00:08:13,291 --> 00:08:15,083
It should be any time now.

109
00:08:15,166 --> 00:08:17,333
[Lord and Lady Bayford chuckle]

110
00:08:25,041 --> 00:08:26,291
Father.

111
00:08:29,083 --> 00:08:30,875
What in the world?

112
00:08:33,541 --> 00:08:36,291
Looks almost… almost like a--

113
00:08:36,375 --> 00:08:37,458
A dragon.

114
00:08:48,208 --> 00:08:50,208
[horn bellowing]

115
00:08:57,458 --> 00:08:59,250
[horn bellowing continues]

116
00:09:07,125 --> 00:09:09,291
-It's okay.
-[Lady Bayford chuckles]

117
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:15,375
[ethereal music playing]

118
00:09:30,875 --> 00:09:33,041
[breathes deeply]

119
00:09:48,666 --> 00:09:51,708
Oh, my heavens. [chuckles]

120
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,250
[gasps]

121
00:10:35,791 --> 00:10:36,958
It's magnificent.

122
00:10:37,708 --> 00:10:40,500
My lords, my ladies,

123
00:10:40,583 --> 00:10:43,125
be welcome to the Kingdom of Aurea.

124
00:10:43,666 --> 00:10:45,958
The royal family is at prayer,

125
00:10:46,041 --> 00:10:48,208
but word has been sent of your arrival.

126
00:10:48,291 --> 00:10:51,041
In the meantime, your rooms have been made ready.

127
00:10:51,666 --> 00:10:53,000
If you will follow me.

128
00:10:55,208 --> 00:10:56,333
[Floria] Is this a dream?

129
00:10:57,250 --> 00:11:00,291
If so, can I move in and never wake up?

130
00:11:00,375 --> 00:11:01,833
[Lady Bayford shushes]

131
00:11:01,916 --> 00:11:04,916
If you want these people to think we belong here,

132
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,166
you can't act so easily impressed.

133
00:11:08,666 --> 00:11:11,000
What do you think, Ellie? Hmm?

134
00:11:11,083 --> 00:11:14,083
I think I had a rather limited definition of wealthy.

135
00:11:14,625 --> 00:11:16,625
[birds chirping]

136
00:11:35,416 --> 00:11:38,458
[chamberlain]
I pray this is to your liking, my lady.

137
00:11:39,541 --> 00:11:41,125
A bath has been drawn

138
00:11:41,916 --> 00:11:43,916
and supper has been carried hence.

139
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:48,541
At first light, I shall return to convey you

140
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:50,666
to meet His Royal Highness.

141
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:53,250
Henry, Prince of Aurea.

142
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,166
[chuckles softly]

143
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:57,458
[Lady Bayford] Floria, stop touching everything.

144
00:12:00,583 --> 00:12:01,791
Is something wrong?

145
00:12:02,708 --> 00:12:05,250
-I just hope he's kind.
-Hmm.

146
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:06,500
-And well-read.
-Yeah.

147
00:12:07,083 --> 00:12:08,083
Handsome.

148
00:12:10,541 --> 00:12:13,333
Let's all give Elodie some privacy.

149
00:12:13,416 --> 00:12:16,708
She can use the time to settle in, as we all could.

150
00:12:16,791 --> 00:12:18,000
Oh, indeed.

151
00:12:18,916 --> 00:12:19,875
Come.

152
00:12:47,625 --> 00:12:49,625
[birds chirping]

153
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:16,375
[maid] M'lady.

154
00:13:17,291 --> 00:13:18,666
Everyone's waiting.

155
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:40,583
[wind whistling outside]

156
00:13:58,208 --> 00:13:59,166
[sighs]

157
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:32,500
Ellie?

158
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:36,625
I can't sleep.

159
00:14:41,875 --> 00:14:44,375
I still can't believe you're going to live here from now on.

160
00:14:45,208 --> 00:14:46,416
You and me both.

161
00:14:47,708 --> 00:14:50,125
I keep thinking, if only Mother were alive,

162
00:14:51,208 --> 00:14:53,583
I could just talk to her about all of this.

163
00:14:55,291 --> 00:14:57,166
Perhaps you could talk to Stepmother.

164
00:14:58,083 --> 00:15:01,333
She means well, even if she is a bit…

165
00:15:01,416 --> 00:15:04,125
-Exhausting?
-[chuckles]

166
00:15:06,333 --> 00:15:09,333
It'll be fine. You'll see.

167
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:13,375
You're Elodie. You can do anything.

168
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:18,458
[Queen Isabelle]
What is your greatest strength?

169
00:15:20,041 --> 00:15:22,000
[Elodie] I always tell the truth, Your Majesty.

170
00:15:22,708 --> 00:15:25,708
[Queen Isabelle]
Some might call that a weakness.

171
00:15:26,875 --> 00:15:28,166
Do you know your heart?

172
00:15:28,916 --> 00:15:30,833
[Elodie] I believe I do, Your Majesty.

173
00:15:30,916 --> 00:15:33,041
[Queen Isabelle]
And what is it telling you now?

174
00:15:33,125 --> 00:15:37,125
In truth, it is beating too loudly for me to hear much of anything, Your Majesty.

175
00:15:38,166 --> 00:15:39,625
[Queen Isabelle] Arise, Elodie.

176
00:15:47,916 --> 00:15:49,000
I'm Henry.

177
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:52,416
Very pleased to finally meet you, my lady.

178
00:15:53,416 --> 00:15:54,291
We all are.

179
00:15:55,708 --> 00:15:58,041
My son understates our joy.

180
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:00,125
And if I may say so,

181
00:16:00,708 --> 00:16:03,291
your father has understated your beauty.

182
00:16:03,875 --> 00:16:07,500
I've never known my father to understate much of anything, Your Majesty.

183
00:16:07,583 --> 00:16:09,666
[chuckles] I see she arrives with some wit.

184
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:13,083
Should you want it or not, Your Majesty.

185
00:16:13,166 --> 00:16:14,625
And you must be Floria.

186
00:16:16,416 --> 00:16:19,666
It seems even a harsh clime can grow the fairest flowers.

187
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:21,583
I love your castle.

188
00:16:21,666 --> 00:16:24,041
I mean, I really love it.

189
00:16:24,125 --> 00:16:24,958
Like, a lot…

190
00:16:27,041 --> 00:16:27,875
Your Majesty.

191
00:16:28,458 --> 00:16:30,458
You are to make yourself at home, child.

192
00:16:30,541 --> 00:16:35,208
We elders have some trivial matters like weddings to attend to.

193
00:16:35,291 --> 00:16:36,208
[Lord Bayford] Yes…

194
00:16:36,875 --> 00:16:40,291
Your correspondence made mention of some particulars

195
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:42,416
you wish to discuss in person.

196
00:16:42,916 --> 00:16:45,333
-The two of us can confer in private.
-Yes.

197
00:16:45,416 --> 00:16:47,625
It's nothing to bore our young people with.

198
00:16:48,916 --> 00:16:50,958
They have a far more important task at hand.

199
00:16:52,125 --> 00:16:53,958
They must get to know each other.

200
00:17:07,125 --> 00:17:09,125
[Henry] Do you have any questions of me?

201
00:17:10,791 --> 00:17:12,375
[Elodie] Questions of what subject?

202
00:17:12,958 --> 00:17:14,458
You may choose the subject.

203
00:17:17,333 --> 00:17:18,708
What do you think about me?

204
00:17:20,208 --> 00:17:21,208
Pardon?

205
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:25,625
Well, you seem disinterested at best, which is your prerogative,

206
00:17:25,708 --> 00:17:28,416
but I'd like to know if the person I'm being guilted into marrying

207
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:29,875
truly likes me or not.

208
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:32,500
[scoffs lightly]

209
00:17:32,583 --> 00:17:35,541
If my attitude offends you, I do apologize. It was not my intent.

210
00:17:38,833 --> 00:17:43,750
However, I was unaware that, um, you were being guilted into anything.

211
00:17:46,041 --> 00:17:49,916
The land where I come from is exactly how your mother explained.

212
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,125
Harsh and barren.

213
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,083
This union will save us.

214
00:17:56,166 --> 00:17:57,708
I've made my peace with it.

215
00:17:58,583 --> 00:18:02,000
My happiness is a small price to pay for the future of my people.

216
00:18:05,791 --> 00:18:06,750
Is something wrong?

217
00:18:09,375 --> 00:18:10,375
It's just…

218
00:18:11,875 --> 00:18:15,750
In the letter you sent in advance of your arrival, you sounded different.

219
00:18:15,833 --> 00:18:18,541
[chuckles] Different. In what way?

220
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:20,625
Far more, um…

221
00:18:22,791 --> 00:18:23,791
flowery.

222
00:18:23,875 --> 00:18:25,500
[both laugh]

223
00:18:25,583 --> 00:18:29,458
Maybe that's because my stepmother dictated most of it

224
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:32,958
and my sister's idea was the heart…

225
00:18:33,666 --> 00:18:35,458
-The heart.
-Mmm.

226
00:18:35,541 --> 00:18:38,041
I thought it was some sort of provincial insignia.

227
00:18:41,458 --> 00:18:42,708
You actually drew this?

228
00:18:42,791 --> 00:18:44,041
[chuckles]

229
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:48,083
Hold on. It's a maze, isn't it?

230
00:18:48,166 --> 00:18:50,041
"I hope you'll get to know my heart."

231
00:18:50,125 --> 00:18:51,625
That is very clever.

232
00:18:53,583 --> 00:18:56,125
I used to make them for Floria when she was little.

233
00:18:57,083 --> 00:18:59,583
-May I ask you another question?
-Certainly.

234
00:19:00,458 --> 00:19:02,333
Do they always follow you so closely?

235
00:19:04,625 --> 00:19:06,208
This is them giving me space.

236
00:19:07,833 --> 00:19:08,875
That must be tiring.

237
00:19:09,875 --> 00:19:11,458
It is, actually.

238
00:19:13,916 --> 00:19:17,541
I saw some horses being left unattended at the stables.

239
00:19:21,458 --> 00:19:22,333
Do you ride?

240
00:19:24,333 --> 00:19:26,958
-[horses whinny]
-[riveting music playing]

241
00:19:39,583 --> 00:19:40,583
[Elodie] Hyah!

242
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:55,416
-Where did you learn to ride like that?
-My mother.

243
00:19:56,625 --> 00:19:58,125
Which way now?

244
00:19:58,208 --> 00:20:00,291
Well, depends on what you want to see.

245
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:02,250
Everything.

246
00:20:03,375 --> 00:20:04,583
Very well.

247
00:20:04,666 --> 00:20:05,750
[doors open]

248
00:20:20,375 --> 00:20:21,750
What happened in there?

249
00:20:23,958 --> 00:20:24,833
Speak already.

250
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:28,166
-Is the wedding still on?
-Aye.

251
00:20:28,875 --> 00:20:31,583
You settled on a fair bride price?

252
00:20:31,666 --> 00:20:34,125
More gold than I could ever imagine.

253
00:20:34,208 --> 00:20:35,750
[Lady Bayford gasps softly]

254
00:20:38,625 --> 00:20:40,291
Then why do you look so?

255
00:20:40,375 --> 00:20:41,958
No, it's nothing. I'm fine.

256
00:20:43,958 --> 00:20:46,500
Tell me, you didn't say anything to embarrass us.

257
00:20:46,583 --> 00:20:48,041
No, I did not.

258
00:20:48,125 --> 00:20:51,958
Because it's very important that our two families get along.

259
00:20:52,041 --> 00:20:54,250
Not only for Elodie's sake, but for ours.

260
00:20:54,333 --> 00:20:56,875
I said, nothing! Nothing's wrong.

261
00:21:00,833 --> 00:21:04,333
I saw something, high on the mountain last night.

262
00:21:04,958 --> 00:21:05,958
Torches.

263
00:21:07,875 --> 00:21:09,166
You saw that?

264
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:10,416
I couldn't sleep.

265
00:21:12,708 --> 00:21:14,125
It was an ancient ceremony.

266
00:21:15,041 --> 00:21:17,000
Or rather, one of three.

267
00:21:17,625 --> 00:21:19,541
They're very significant to my family.

268
00:21:20,166 --> 00:21:22,250
For our whole kingdom, really. They, um…

269
00:21:23,916 --> 00:21:25,625
They honor our ancestors.

270
00:21:27,625 --> 00:21:30,333
That's why my mother chose these dates for our wedding.

271
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:32,708
[Elodie] It is quite beautiful.

272
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:34,833
[Henry] Yes, I suppose.

273
00:21:35,916 --> 00:21:38,416
I really don't have anything else to compare it to.

274
00:21:39,458 --> 00:21:41,125
May I confide in you something?

275
00:21:42,083 --> 00:21:43,041
Yes.

276
00:21:43,125 --> 00:21:45,791
My greatest wish is to go see the world.

277
00:21:47,375 --> 00:21:50,583
Really set out and see it, you know?

278
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:52,375
I do, actually.

279
00:21:53,583 --> 00:21:54,833
It's my life's dream.

280
00:21:57,333 --> 00:22:01,708
For as long as I can remember, I've longed to explore the distant lands.

281
00:22:02,541 --> 00:22:04,208
The ones you only read about.

282
00:22:05,291 --> 00:22:06,500
[Elodie chuckles softly]

283
00:22:08,291 --> 00:22:10,166
Perhaps, one day, we will.

284
00:22:12,208 --> 00:22:13,291
Perhaps.

285
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,500
[bell tolling]

286
00:22:27,375 --> 00:22:29,458
[woman] And the orange in this area.

287
00:22:33,125 --> 00:22:36,000
[Lady Bayford]
Everything's so beautiful, Your Majesty.

288
00:22:36,083 --> 00:22:37,666
Well, I'm glad you approve.

289
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:40,125
Very elegant.

290
00:22:42,541 --> 00:22:44,750
You have impeccable taste.

291
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:49,333
Everything is just so exquisite.

292
00:22:49,416 --> 00:22:52,166
I'm sorry, is there something I can help you with?

293
00:22:52,833 --> 00:22:55,750
I just thought we might become better acquainted,

294
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:58,708
seeing as we're about to be family.

295
00:22:58,791 --> 00:23:02,333
Ah, this must be very exciting for you.

296
00:23:02,416 --> 00:23:05,416
Your father was a rope maker, was he not?

297
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:07,208
The finest in the city.

298
00:23:07,291 --> 00:23:09,958
And here you are. You've climbed so high.

299
00:23:11,041 --> 00:23:14,000
Still, one mustn't forget one's station.

300
00:23:14,916 --> 00:23:16,875
Nor place undue import

301
00:23:16,958 --> 00:23:20,708
on what is ultimately a transaction born of necessity.

302
00:23:21,791 --> 00:23:24,000
Uh… "Necessity"?

303
00:23:24,583 --> 00:23:26,208
Well, your family needs money.

304
00:23:26,875 --> 00:23:28,458
My family needs a bride.

305
00:23:29,166 --> 00:23:31,791
What we don't need is more family.

306
00:23:33,291 --> 00:23:35,583
I wish all the best for Henry and Eloise.

307
00:23:35,666 --> 00:23:37,000
-I merely--
-Elodie.

308
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:38,333
Pardon?

309
00:23:40,291 --> 00:23:43,416
My stepdaughter. Her name is Elodie.

310
00:23:44,916 --> 00:23:46,000
That's what I said.

311
00:23:46,958 --> 00:23:48,291
Good day, Lady Bayford.

312
00:24:05,416 --> 00:24:06,250
It's perfect.

313
00:24:07,166 --> 00:24:08,833
Everything in here is so perfect.

314
00:24:13,125 --> 00:24:14,125
[Elodie] Stepmother.

315
00:24:15,875 --> 00:24:17,250
Is something the matter?

316
00:24:18,708 --> 00:24:19,666
Elodie,

317
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:23,041
I know we haven't always been close,

318
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:25,791
but I need you to listen to me now.

319
00:24:26,541 --> 00:24:29,625
This wedding… is a mistake.

320
00:24:29,708 --> 00:24:30,708
[scoffs] What?

321
00:24:33,125 --> 00:24:34,458
I don't understand.

322
00:24:34,541 --> 00:24:36,958
These people, I don't trust them.

323
00:24:37,541 --> 00:24:41,041
It's hard to explain, but a mother knows these things.

324
00:24:41,125 --> 00:24:43,250
Only yesterday, you were enamored by this place.

325
00:24:43,333 --> 00:24:44,291
Floria.

326
00:24:44,375 --> 00:24:45,458
I was wrong.

327
00:24:46,625 --> 00:24:50,750
They may be royalty, but that doesn't make them good people.

328
00:24:52,166 --> 00:24:53,000
[Elodie] Well…

329
00:24:54,125 --> 00:24:57,208
-What does Father think?
-He refuses to talk about it.

330
00:24:57,291 --> 00:25:01,458
And when I try to tell him my worries, he snaps at me.

331
00:25:01,541 --> 00:25:04,250
-Because you're being unreasonable.
-That's enough, Flor.

332
00:25:04,833 --> 00:25:10,000
Elodie, I swear that I only want what's best for you.

333
00:25:15,291 --> 00:25:17,000
Am I interrupting something?

334
00:25:18,708 --> 00:25:19,750
No.

335
00:25:20,666 --> 00:25:21,500
Just…

336
00:25:23,958 --> 00:25:25,000
girl talk.

337
00:25:26,166 --> 00:25:30,416
Well, tomorrow's a big day, and these girls, they need their rest.

338
00:25:33,208 --> 00:25:36,125
Think about what I said. There's still time.

339
00:25:36,708 --> 00:25:37,541
Time for what?

340
00:25:44,625 --> 00:25:47,041
[Lady Bayford] I hope you know what you're doing.

341
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:53,916
Good night, my angels.

342
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,708
-Good night, Father.
-Good night, Father.

343
00:25:58,916 --> 00:25:59,833
Good night.

344
00:26:06,541 --> 00:26:08,541
[birds chirping]

345
00:26:12,583 --> 00:26:14,583
[somber instrumental music playing]

346
00:26:32,666 --> 00:26:33,666
[chuckles]

347
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:56,875
[grunts]

348
00:27:08,375 --> 00:27:09,500
[sniffs]

349
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:27,583
[Elodie sighs deeply]

350
00:27:34,208 --> 00:27:35,041
[Floria] Wow.

351
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
[serene music playing]

352
00:28:10,916 --> 00:28:12,583
[priest] You may kiss the bride.

353
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:33,458
I present my son and new daughter, Elodie, Princess of Aurea.

354
00:28:33,541 --> 00:28:36,125
[guests applaud, cheer]

355
00:28:57,833 --> 00:28:59,166
Goodbye, Father.

356
00:29:22,125 --> 00:29:24,833
[softly] I hope I'm half as beautiful someday as you are today.

357
00:29:26,833 --> 00:29:28,250
Twice as beautiful.

358
00:29:31,041 --> 00:29:33,291
-I love you.
-I love you.

359
00:29:49,208 --> 00:29:53,750
Hey! Hey, hey!

360
00:29:57,875 --> 00:29:59,125
[Elodie] Where are we going?

361
00:29:59,208 --> 00:30:02,416
[Henry] Remember I told you about those ancient ceremonies up on the mountain?

362
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:03,333
[Elodie] Yes.

363
00:30:03,416 --> 00:30:06,333
[Henry] We're going to pay homage to my ancestors.

364
00:30:13,291 --> 00:30:15,583
[wind whistles]

365
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,666
Welcome, Princess.

366
00:31:02,541 --> 00:31:06,083
For generations, it has been our task, our duty,

367
00:31:06,958 --> 00:31:08,500
to protect our people.

368
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:13,083
The price is dear, but so too the reward.

369
00:31:14,291 --> 00:31:15,458
So, tonight,

370
00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:22,041
you join a long line of women who have helped to build this kingdom.

371
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,958
When our ancestors first lay claim to this island,

372
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:32,208
they found they were not its sole inhabitants.

373
00:31:33,166 --> 00:31:35,458
A creature dwelt here first.

374
00:31:36,416 --> 00:31:38,083
The last of its kind.

375
00:31:39,208 --> 00:31:41,208
With savage bloodlust,

376
00:31:41,291 --> 00:31:44,750
the beast left its lair and set upon the village.

377
00:31:46,041 --> 00:31:50,166
So the king gathered his soldiers to avenge his people.

378
00:31:50,916 --> 00:31:53,375
But their steel was no match for the monster,

379
00:31:54,333 --> 00:31:56,791
and each man met his end.

380
00:31:57,875 --> 00:32:00,041
Each save one.

381
00:32:00,958 --> 00:32:05,500
For the king, the beast had a far worse fate in store.

382
00:32:06,333 --> 00:32:10,166
Give up his three beloved daughters and the island could be shared.

383
00:32:11,208 --> 00:32:12,625
A cruel torture.

384
00:32:13,583 --> 00:32:14,791
He adored his daughters,

385
00:32:16,375 --> 00:32:19,041
but his duty to his subjects was stronger.

386
00:32:20,083 --> 00:32:22,500
And so, a pact was made.

387
00:32:22,583 --> 00:32:25,958
The three princesses met their end in the belly of the beast,

388
00:32:26,041 --> 00:32:27,625
and a kingdom was born.

389
00:32:35,333 --> 00:32:38,916
It is this sacrifice we commemorate every generation.

390
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,416
A tradition going back centuries.

391
00:32:52,666 --> 00:32:54,083
Your hand, child.

392
00:33:02,125 --> 00:33:07,708
A legacy of honor and duty you now inherit, Princess Elodie of Aurea.

393
00:33:20,375 --> 00:33:24,458
Let our two lines mingle and fast become one.

394
00:33:25,916 --> 00:33:28,375
She is now of royal blood.

395
00:33:29,958 --> 00:33:31,791
[inhales sharply, exhales]

396
00:33:40,458 --> 00:33:43,583
To ensure that our kingdom thrives forevermore,

397
00:33:44,250 --> 00:33:45,791
pay your due to the realm.

398
00:33:48,291 --> 00:33:50,208
[softly] Toss the coin into the chasm.

399
00:34:02,875 --> 00:34:05,041
The ceremony is now complete.

400
00:34:07,250 --> 00:34:08,916
You may make your return.

401
00:34:12,708 --> 00:34:14,583
I'm supposed to carry you back.

402
00:34:14,666 --> 00:34:16,666
I'm fine with walking, really.

403
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,875
Floria would love this part.

404
00:34:25,875 --> 00:34:26,916
Close your eyes.

405
00:34:28,083 --> 00:34:29,125
I've got you.

406
00:34:45,541 --> 00:34:47,416
[Henry breathing shakily]

407
00:34:53,625 --> 00:34:54,458
[softly] I'm sorry.

408
00:35:01,458 --> 00:35:02,791
[Elodie screams] No!

409
00:35:06,125 --> 00:35:07,833

410

412

[groans softly]

413
00:35:42,791 --> 00:35:45,166
[groaning]

414
00:36:03,041 --> 00:36:04,625
Help me!

415
00:36:04,708 --> 00:36:06,833
[voice echoing]

416
00:36:15,333 --> 00:36:16,708
[straining]

417
00:36:20,666 --> 00:36:22,291
Help!

418
00:36:23,958 --> 00:36:25,500
Is anyone there?!

419
00:36:25,583 --> 00:36:27,416
[voice echoing]

420
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:30,125

[grunts, groans]

428
00:37:30,666 --> 00:37:32,000
That's not mine.

429
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,666
I am the sacrifice.

430
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,583
I am the sacrifice?

431
00:37:41,958 --> 00:37:43,958
[distant fluttering]

432
00:37:52,541 --> 00:37:54,208

[bird shrieking]

436
00:39:13,416 --> 00:39:14,708
You poor thing.

437
00:39:15,583 --> 00:39:17,041
What happened to you?

438
00:39:23,125 --> 00:39:25,875
[dragon roars]

439
00:39:30,166 --> 00:39:33,166

[Elodie whimpering]

442
00:40:25,708 --> 00:40:27,500
Give me strength, Mother.

443
00:40:28,375 --> 00:40:29,708
[dragon] Mother?

444
00:40:29,791 --> 00:40:32,083

[rumbling]

452
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:29,125
[dragon] Your name, little bird?

453
00:41:31,291 --> 00:41:33,333
Speak your name.

454
00:41:35,125 --> 00:41:36,208
Elodie.

455
00:41:36,833 --> 00:41:40,333
El-o-die.

456
00:41:41,791 --> 00:41:43,375
Exciting.

457
00:41:45,250 --> 00:41:46,416
What do you want?

458
00:41:49,916 --> 00:41:54,333
I want… what is promised.

459
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,875
What is owed.

460
00:42:01,166 --> 00:42:07,041
Every generation, your kind must pay.

461
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:11,750
[softly] My kind?

462
00:42:11,833 --> 00:42:15,166
The scent of royalty betrays you.

463
00:42:16,208 --> 00:42:18,250
It's in your blood.

464
00:42:33,125 --> 00:42:38,625
Now, my favorite part.

465
00:42:41,625 --> 00:42:44,375

[dragon] Did I hurt you?

477
00:44:17,958 --> 00:44:19,458
Quiet now?

478
00:44:20,750 --> 00:44:23,458
[chuckles softly] A clever one.

479
00:44:24,625 --> 00:44:27,541
The last one was over so quick.

[panting]

485
00:45:29,083 --> 00:45:30,958

Don't worry.

Almost caught you, little bird.

513

You hide now, like all the others.

514
00:53:50,458 --> 00:53:52,833
It makes no difference.

515
00:53:54,750 --> 00:53:59,291

The entrance cave.

545
00:58:16,250 --> 00:58:20,666
Following down into the bird cave.

546

Through the twisted tunnel…

547
00:58:28,125 --> 00:58:29,625

Keep following down.

I am here.

551
00:58:42,125 --> 00:58:43,416
How do I escape?

552
00:58:47,791 --> 00:58:48,708

I've done what you paid for, milord. I'll just wait up top.

You'll do no such thing.

It's not my mercy that you should seek.

648

Call her.

01:22:10,625 --> 01:22:12,041
[Floria screams]

744
01:22:14,833 --> 01:22:16,625
Get off of me!

745
01:22:17,208 --> 01:22:18,916
Let go! Off of me!

746
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:20,166
Throw her in.

747
01:22:21,250 --> 01:22:22,250
[Floria screams]

748
01:22:44,958 --> 01:22:46,166
Floria!

749
01:22:46,833 --> 01:22:48,541
Floria!

750
01:22:50,166 --> 01:22:51,916
Floria!

751
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,333
[Floria screaming]

752
01:23:24,166 --> 01:23:25,416
[grunts]

753
01:23:33,083 --> 01:23:34,125
[sniffs]

754
01:23:43,250 --> 01:23:44,791
[Elodie] I'm coming for you, Flor.

755
01:24:37,791 --> 01:24:39,791
[dragon snarls]

756
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:47,708
[dragon] My little ones…

757
01:24:50,375 --> 01:24:52,333
They did not let you live.

758
01:24:54,666 --> 01:24:57,958
Nor shall I let Elodie.

759
01:25:09,083 --> 01:25:12,583
Your sister will come for you.

760
01:25:25,958 --> 01:25:27,750
[clanging]

761
01:25:28,875 --> 01:25:30,791
There she is now.

762
01:25:54,666 --> 01:25:56,791
Hello, Floria. Floria, can you hear me?

763
01:25:57,666 --> 01:25:58,583
Wake up!

764
01:25:58,666 --> 01:26:00,375
We need to hurry.

765
01:26:00,458 --> 01:26:01,500
Floria!

766
01:26:02,166 --> 01:26:03,000
Ellie.

767
01:26:06,041 --> 01:26:07,500
Elodie, you're alive.

768
01:26:08,583 --> 01:26:10,958
Okay. I'm going to get you out of here.

769
01:26:13,625 --> 01:26:14,875
[screams in pain]

770
01:26:15,708 --> 01:26:18,208
My leg. I hurt it when I fell.

771
01:26:19,666 --> 01:26:21,125
We don't have time, Flor.

772
01:26:27,875 --> 01:26:29,458
[roars]

773
01:26:31,750 --> 01:26:33,708
No, no, no. Not yet.

774
01:26:33,791 --> 01:26:34,833
What now?

775
01:26:34,916 --> 01:26:36,333
You have to hide quickly.

776
01:26:36,416 --> 01:26:37,583
What about you?

777
01:26:37,666 --> 01:26:39,125
I must tell her the truth.

778
01:26:39,208 --> 01:26:40,083
Come on.

779
01:26:50,833 --> 01:26:52,833
[sniffing]

780
01:26:56,416 --> 01:26:59,125
Where are you hiding?

781
01:27:03,333 --> 01:27:04,541
[Elodie softly] Dragon.

782
01:27:09,375 --> 01:27:11,166
[dragon] That won't kill me,

783
01:27:12,250 --> 01:27:14,625
but it will make me angry.

784
01:27:14,708 --> 01:27:15,958
Good.

785
01:27:16,583 --> 01:27:18,625
I'm angry too.

786
01:27:23,333 --> 01:27:25,041
We have both been lied to.

787
01:27:25,708 --> 01:27:27,625
They said you set upon their village.

788
01:27:27,708 --> 01:27:30,041
That the king came only to defend his people.

789
01:27:30,750 --> 01:27:33,708
He came unprovoked.

790
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:36,291
I know what they did.

791
01:27:37,041 --> 01:27:38,500
I know they killed your children.

792
01:27:39,083 --> 01:27:41,583
"They"? You!

793
01:27:41,666 --> 01:27:44,125
Your kind, your blood.

794
01:27:44,208 --> 01:27:45,041
No!

795
01:27:45,125 --> 01:27:48,875
My daughters were the last of my line.

796
01:27:48,958 --> 01:27:53,083
So, I will take their daughters until my final breath.

797
01:27:53,791 --> 01:27:57,000
Except you haven't. We are not their daughters.

798
01:27:57,083 --> 01:27:58,750
More lies.

799
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:04,666
[Elodie screams]

800
01:28:32,666 --> 01:28:34,708
[screaming]

801
01:28:36,500 --> 01:28:37,625
Ellie!

802
01:28:52,041 --> 01:28:56,791
Now, you will know my daughters' pain.

803
01:29:03,791 --> 01:29:05,333
[screaming]

804
01:29:08,125 --> 01:29:09,333
[roars]

805
01:29:29,041 --> 01:29:31,541
[dragon growls softly]

806
01:29:38,500 --> 01:29:40,291
[Elodie yells]

807
01:29:41,458 --> 01:29:43,375
[growls]

808
01:29:44,250 --> 01:29:46,500
I am not one of them!

809
01:29:51,625 --> 01:29:53,916
I smell it in your blood.

810
01:29:56,500 --> 01:29:58,625
[screeches]

811
01:31:19,833 --> 01:31:23,416
El-o-die.

812
01:31:25,666 --> 01:31:28,041
Accept your fate…

813
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,000
as I have mine.

814
01:31:40,083 --> 01:31:43,708
We are to die alone.

815
01:31:51,041 --> 01:31:52,333
No.

816
01:31:55,916 --> 01:31:57,875
I have an army with me.

817
01:32:00,541 --> 01:32:04,416
Every innocent woman whose life was stolen down here.

818
01:32:06,708 --> 01:32:10,958
Your kind were never innocent.

819
01:32:18,125 --> 01:32:19,375
Then go ahead.

820
01:32:23,583 --> 01:32:25,208
Show me your fire.

821
01:32:30,125 --> 01:32:30,958
Well?

822
01:32:32,291 --> 01:32:33,750
What are you waiting for?

823
01:32:36,875 --> 01:32:37,958
Burn me.

824
01:32:40,583 --> 01:32:41,625
Burn me!

825
01:32:47,500 --> 01:32:49,500
[screeching]

826
01:33:25,958 --> 01:33:27,958
[rugged breathing]

827
01:33:45,583 --> 01:33:47,208
My sister had this too.

828
01:33:48,625 --> 01:33:49,750
All of us did.

829
01:33:50,750 --> 01:33:52,875
That is how they make us royal.

830
01:33:54,250 --> 01:33:56,458
That is the blood you smell.

831
01:34:06,958 --> 01:34:08,125
They fooled you.

832
01:34:10,125 --> 01:34:13,458
You've been killing innocent daughters just like they did.

833
01:34:21,541 --> 01:34:24,541
Then, end it.

834
01:34:51,041 --> 01:34:51,875
No.

835
01:34:56,750 --> 01:34:59,000
I'm through doing what I'm told.

836
01:36:12,916 --> 01:36:14,916
[crowd murmuring]

837
01:36:19,041 --> 01:36:19,875
Elodie.

838
01:36:26,708 --> 01:36:29,541
You must believe me. I haven't slept a moment since--

839
01:36:29,625 --> 01:36:31,458
Since you tried to kill my sister?

840
01:36:32,958 --> 01:36:33,958
[Henry] I had no choice.

841
01:36:34,041 --> 01:36:37,000
Don't you dare explain yourself to this…

842
01:36:37,083 --> 01:36:38,666
this commoner.

843
01:36:42,916 --> 01:36:44,583
Is she to be the third?

844
01:36:45,541 --> 01:36:47,041
Princess number three.

845
01:36:48,791 --> 01:36:52,250
She's the last, and then I'll be free to marry whoever I--

846
01:36:52,333 --> 01:36:54,000
That's enough, Henry.

847
01:36:54,958 --> 01:36:57,375
You know nothing of what we've endured.

848
01:36:58,041 --> 01:37:00,291
You know nothing of our story.

849
01:37:08,625 --> 01:37:10,000
Take your family

850
01:37:11,833 --> 01:37:13,166
and run.

851
01:37:15,208 --> 01:37:16,541
[man] Come. Let's go.

852
01:37:18,375 --> 01:37:21,833
I will offer you all one last chance to do the same.

853
01:37:29,333 --> 01:37:30,166
No?

854
01:37:32,250 --> 01:37:34,750
You insolent creature.

855
01:37:35,791 --> 01:37:37,541
You think we ought to fear you now?

856
01:37:38,958 --> 01:37:39,791
Why?

857
01:37:40,541 --> 01:37:43,750
Because you somehow managed to escape the dragon?

858
01:37:47,541 --> 01:37:49,708
It's not me you should fear.

859
01:37:50,958 --> 01:37:54,291
This is the end of your story.

860
01:37:55,375 --> 01:37:56,375
[woman] Run!

861
01:38:10,750 --> 01:38:13,416
-[woman] It's the dragon!
-[man] Run!

862
01:38:14,166 --> 01:38:16,125
[roars]

863
01:38:36,125 --> 01:38:42,833
No!

864
01:39:28,958 --> 01:39:31,125
[sailor 1] Someone give me a hand with this barrel.

865
01:39:31,208 --> 01:39:32,875
[sailor 2] Let's be sharp there, lads.

866
01:39:32,958 --> 01:39:35,125
[Lady Bayford] You can't be serious.

867
01:39:35,208 --> 01:39:36,083
[Elodie] But I am.

868
01:39:36,166 --> 01:39:37,916
We'll run it together.

869
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:39,583
We've got a bounty of supplies.

870
01:39:39,666 --> 01:39:42,041
Enough to get us through this freeze and the next.

871
01:39:42,125 --> 01:39:43,166
Oh, Elodie.

872
01:39:43,250 --> 01:39:46,458
You're the only person I trust to look after our people, Mother.

873
01:39:55,333 --> 01:39:56,500
Can I help too?

874
01:39:59,791 --> 01:40:00,625
Floria.

875
01:40:01,166 --> 01:40:02,791
I'm counting on it.

876
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:14,541
[Floria] Stepmother. Stepmother, come and see this.

877
01:40:14,625 --> 01:40:16,208
[Lady Bayford] Oh, wide heavens!

878
01:40:16,291 --> 01:40:19,458
[sailor] My lady, what course shall we steer?

879
01:40:21,750 --> 01:40:22,750
Home.
